# MASD – Advanced Mathematics for Data Science (4th Year ESI)
This repository contains practical assignments (TPs) from my 4th-year MASD (Mathématiques Avancées pour la Science de Données) course at École Supérieure d'Informatique (ESI), Algiers. It focuses on optimization methods, implemented from scratch and analyzed through comparisons.

## Contents
### 1. Differentiable Optimization Methods (Unconstrained)

  - Fixed-step Gradient Descent
  
  - Optimal-step Gradient Descent
  
  - Variable-step Gradient Descent
  
  - Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (with Convergence Rate)
  
  - Newton’s Method
  
  - Quasi-Newton (BFGS)

### 2. Non-Differentiable Optimization Methods (Unconstrained)

  - Subgradient Method
  
  - Proximal Gradient Method

### 3. Constrained Optimization Methods

  - Fixed-step Projected Gradient Descent
  
  - Exterior Penalty Method
  
  - Interior Penalty Method
  
  - Uzawa Algorithm

## Note
- I implemented each method from scratch (without using high-level optimization libraries)
  and compared it with other methods of the same category
